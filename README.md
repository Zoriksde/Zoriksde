## Zoriksde [Patryk Przybysz] 👋

⚡ Hi, How you doin bro?

If you are reading this, you are probably interested in my personality (hope so 😄)
Let me introduce myself then...

I'm Patryk Przybysz - a passionate fullstack developer and machine learning specialist. It's better to show something about me than spending time on talking
about bla bla bla...

I have made a great progress for 5 years from now, when my coding career has started 😃

* [OI - Computer Science Olympiad](https://www.oi.edu.pl/l/28oi_1etap_wyniki/)
* [Over 80 problems solved on CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
* [C1 English Certificate](https://thepoint.pl/)
* Machine Learning (with certificates) - Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Deep Learning etc.
* Fullstack Developer (with certificates) - ReactJS, NodeJS, Databases etc.
* [Pathfinding Visualizer Project](https://react-pathfinding.vercel.app/)
* [Sorting Visualizer Project](https://react-sorting.vercel.app/)
* [Neural Network from Scratch Project](https://github.com/Zoriksde/python-neural-network)
* and a lot of more...

That's only a small part of my achievements 😆

I do have 5 years of experience in Computer Science. 

I have run my own business (wtf bro 😤) 3 years ago. I have been working for several companies also. 

I'm ambitious, motivatied, concetrated and pleased while i'm working in this kind of stuff ❤️ - love it!

Have you ever imagined life without modern technologies? Naah, me neither. Technology evolves, everything is chainging everyday 😮 - yeep it is.
Then being aware of all tech news around us is probably impossible, however i try my best 💪 - it just makes me proud of myself.

What's more I do have an amazing math background behind Machine Learning, Algorithms etc. 

Did i mention my math successes? Oh well, here it is:
* ODI AGH - Math Olympiad Finalist
* Working as a tutor for over 2 years
* probably some more stuff here... 😉

I love spending free time on gym - there has to be an equality between coding and sport ❤️☀️ 

If you are interested in work with me - amazing brooo, i am surely into it!

My fav quotes:
> Show me your code, i will tell you who you are

> If you can't explain it in simple words, you don't understand it
