That's only a small part of my achievements 😆

I do have 7 years of experience in Computer Science. 

I have been working for several companies so far, i've gained a lot of experience with working as software engineer. 

I'm ambitious, motivatied, concetrated and pleased while i'm working in this kind of stuff ❤️ - love it!

Have you ever imagined life without modern technologies? Naah, me neither. Technology evolves, everything is changing everyday 😮 - yeep it is.
Then being aware of all tech news around us is probably impossible, however i try my best 💪 - it just makes me proud of myself.

I love spending free time on gym - there has to be an equality between coding and sport ❤️☀️
